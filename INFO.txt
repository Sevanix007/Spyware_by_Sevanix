Hi! I am a programmer - student. This is my project for spying another PCs. It works only on Windows(7,8,10,11) and Linux as Python script
He adds himself to autoload, sends me the user's public IP and waits until I send a command by mail, which he will execute and send me the necessary data by email. 
In the future, I plan to finalize the project and add more functions, as well as find a way to reduce the weight of the program or transfer it to C++

Some of the functions are not mentioned in the source code because I don't want them to be open source.
I did not make this program for bad purposes.
